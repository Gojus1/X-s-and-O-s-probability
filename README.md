# X-s-and-O-s-probability
Was bored, so wanted to proof that the game tic tac toe or otherwise know as X's and O's game is rigged

How It Works:
* Each bot makes random moves.
* The game ends when a bot wins or the board is full (meaning a tie).
* The simulation runs multiple games (default: 10000) and prints the results.

* Expected result:
<pre>After 10000 games:
X's Won: 5852 (58.52%)
O's Won: 2816 (28.16%)
Ties: 1332 (13.32%)</pre>

The simple reason for this is that 2 players share 9 squares, so X's(or just the first player) get 5 squares and O's get only 4.

So basically the game is rigged would not recommend betting your money XD.
